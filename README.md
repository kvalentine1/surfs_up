Weather analysis of Oahu to determine viability of a potential surf and shake shop business.

## Overview
The purpose of this analaysis is to analyze the climate of the island Oahu year round. The goal is to determine if Oahu would be a good location for our client to open up a Surf and Shake shop selling surfing equipment and milkshakes. We analyzed weather data from stations across the island to see what temperatures and precipitation look like throughout the year so that our client can determine if there are enough good weather days to keep the shop in business.

## Results
For this assignment, we looked specifically at historical weather data for the months of June and December. 
  - The minimum and maximum temperatures for June were 64 degrees and 85 degrees respectively. 
  - The minimum and maximum temperatures for December were 56 degrees and 83 degrees respectively.
  - June temperatures averaged at 74.9 degrees and December temperatures averaged at 71 degrees.
  - The 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles for June were 73, 75, and 77 degrees respectively indicating consistent temperatures throughout the month.
  - The 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles for December were 69, 71, and 74 degrees respectively. This also indicates pretty standard temperatures throughout     the month, albeit a little cooler which is common for winter.
  
 Additionally, the precipitation data for each month was analyzed.
  - The minimum and maximum rainfall for June was 0 to 4.43 inches respectively. 
  - The minimum and maximum rainfall for December was 0 to 6.42 inches respectively.
  - June rainfall averaged at .14 inches and December rainfall averaged at .22 inches.

## Summary
From this data, we can conclude that Oahu, Hawai'i would be an excellent location for a Surf and Shake shop. The average temperature difference between June and December is only 3.9 degrees and the max high tempteratures differs by 2 degrees indicating that the temperature is relatively consistent all year long. Through our additional query, we also see that the precipitation throughout the year is not extreme and does not indicate that precipitation would impact the business' ability to operate on a regular basis. Included with this data analysis are two charts showing the frequency of temperatures in June and December and both indicate that the tempterature for both months is most frequently in the 70s. Also included are two data frames showing temperature and precipitation by date so that further analysis can be done to see the relationship between temperature and precipitation.
